**TL;DR:** Using `const` means that once a variable is assigned, it cannot be reassigned. Preferring const will help you to not be tempted to use the same variable for different uses, and make your code clearer. If a variable needs to be reassigned, in a for loop, for example, use `let` to declare it. Another important aspect of `let` is that a variable declared using it is only available in the block scope in which it was defined. `var` is function scoped, not block scoped, and [shouldn't be used in ES6](https://hackernoon.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-var-anymore-f109a58b9b70) now that you have const and let at your disposal

**Otherwise:** Debugging becomes way more cumbersome when following a variable that frequently changes
