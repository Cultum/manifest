**TL;DR:** The opening curly braces of a code block should be in the same line of the opening statement

### Code Example

```javascript
// Do
function someFunction() {
  // code block
}

// Avoid
function someFunction()
{
  // code block
}
```

**Otherwise:** Deferring from this best practice might lead to unexpected results, as seen in the StackOverflow thread below:
