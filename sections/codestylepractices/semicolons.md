**TL;DR:** While not unanimously agreed upon, it is still recommended to put a semicolon at the end of each statement. This will make your code more readable and explicit to other developers who read it

**Otherwise:** As seen in the previous section, JavaScript's interpreter automatically adds a semicolon at the end of a statement if there isn't one, or considers a statement as not ended where it should, which might lead to some undesired results

### Code example

```javascript
// Do
const count = 2;
(function doSomething() {
  // do something amazing
}());

// Avoid — throws exception
const count = 2 // it tries to run 2(), but 2 is not a function
(function doSomething() {
  // do something amazing
}())
```
