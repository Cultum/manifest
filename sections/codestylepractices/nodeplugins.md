**TL;DR:** On top of ESLint standard rules that cover vanilla JS only, add Node-specific plugins like [eslint-plugin-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-node), [eslint-plugin-mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-mocha) and [eslint-plugin-node-security](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-security)

**Otherwise:** Many faulty Node.js code patterns might escape under the radar. For example, developers might require(variableAsPath) files with a variable given as path which allows attackers to execute any JS script. Node.js linters can detect such patterns and complain early
