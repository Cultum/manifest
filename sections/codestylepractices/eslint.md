**TL;DR:** [ESLint](https://eslint.org) is the de-facto standard for checking possible code errors and fixing code style, not only to identify nitty-gritty spacing issues but also to detect serious code anti-patterns like developers throwing errors without classification. Though ESLint can automatically fix code styles, other tools like [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) and [beautify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-beautify) are more powerful in formatting the fix and work in conjunction with ESLint

**Otherwise:** Developers will focus on tedious spacing and line-width concerns and time might be wasted overthinking about the project's code style
